# python-sha1

This is a basic example of how the sha1 can be implemented in python. 

There are three files attached to the project. 

  1. sha1.py
  2. utilities.py
  3. testSha.py 
  
sha1.py contains the function that receives a text argument and returns the hash. 

utilties.py is a setup of functions created to asist in some of the bitwise operations. 

testSha.py is a simple program where text is input and ran through the sha1 function to display the hash.

Simply download all three files and place them in the same directory.
Then run the testSha.py from the terminal or command prompt.
